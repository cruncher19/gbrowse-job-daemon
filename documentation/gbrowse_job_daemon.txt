The job daemon runs as a system service.

Operation:
    it can be started and stopped like this:
    
        sudo service gbrowse_job_daemon stop
        sudo service gbrowse_job_daemon start
        sudo service gbrowse_job_daemon restart

    The daemon writes to a log file at /var/log/gbrowse_job_daemon.log


How it works:
    The job daemons monitors the file: /usr/share/gbrowse_job_daemon/jobs
        entries in the jobs file have the following format:
            task|name of file containing dumped cookie|name of file containing dumped session|name of file containing job configuration|user email address|name of file containing upload parameters

            ex:
            blast|/usr/share/gbrowse_job_daemon/cookies/J6apldUI8M|/usr/share/gbrowse_job_daemon/sessions/T1cAd_1u23|/usr/share/gbrowse_job_daemon/configs/NWCy2OALcr|bradcovey@gmail.com|testblast|/tmp/q8SFVfhGdy
    
    Every 15 seconds(I think?) the job daemon spawns a child

        if the jobs file is empty the child exits without doing anything
        otherwise the child gets the first job off of the top of the file and processes it

        The child determines what to do based on the "task" section of the jobs entry.

        The child performs the task, stores the results, and modifies the file containing upload parameters to include the paths to the results.
        The child adds an entry to the completed_jobs file and exits
    
    After spawning the child the parent checks each of its active children processes to see if they are ready to be reaped
    if the parent reaps a child it spawns a headless(self reaping) child that pulls the first entry out of the completed_jobs file and performs the upload
    To perform the upload the child calls upload_data with the name of the file containing upload parameters

    Next the child sends an email to the user telling them that their job is complete and the child exits
